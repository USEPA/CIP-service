  title: CIP-service Indexing API
  description: CIP-service is a project of the US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Water providing containers, logic and data for the task of associating or _indexing_ hydrologic 
    features with NHDPlus features at multiple resolutions.  CIP-service supports a variety of purposes indexing to catchments, reaches or navigating the NHDPlus network for discovery or flow analysis.  
    The majority of logic occurs within a containerized PostgreSQL database with additional containers providing support products such as an API, Jupyter Notebooks and sample demo applications.  
    All components of the provided container stack are open source.
