The CIP-service project provides an open source Geoserver container for GIS purposes.  However, some organizations may wish to use proprietary Esri Enterprise software instead.

Scripts in this directory support extracting CIP-service datasets into Esri file geodatabases using user provided and user licensed Esri software (arcpy).  These extracts may then be used with ArcGIS Server or other Esri platforms.
